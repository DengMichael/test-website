# test-website
My first website

What I hope to achieve 
Connect with database with username data
VoIP
Easy organisation
External planner

Perhaps a profile like that of Twitch/Discord would work.
Top buttons - Party members, browse games, home page, search, recent messages.

Left side - Online friends (can show all friends like league.)
-Friends who need a certain role in a game are shown on the left, show only games you have, perhaps like Discord try and detect games you have.
-Discord-like meet-up activation.
